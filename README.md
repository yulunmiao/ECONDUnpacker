# ECOND Raw data unpacking

This ECOND raw data unpacking is based on stand alone HGCal Unpacker at
https://gitlab.cern.ch/hgcal-integration/hgcal-raw-data-unpacking

To install clone the repository locally

```
git clone git@github.com:yulunmiao/ECONDUnpacker.git

The code is expected to be compatible with c++11.
The structure of the directories is similar to the one used in CMSSW.
The test directory is reserved for test units and executables.

## Executables

Some extra arguments are
```--output [output file name]``` produces a human readable output file containing ECOND information
and
```--json [output json file name]``` produces a json file containing ECOND information
Test output, generated by 
```
./bin/testHGCalUnpacker --input test_capture_ASIC.csv --json testjson.json --output testoutput.txt 
```
Test data can be found at ```testjson.json``` and ```testoutput.txt```, with the run-time log```log.txt```
